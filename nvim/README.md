# NVIM

This directory contains some of the setup and configuuration files that I used to set-up NeoVim.

⚠️: It was initially used for NeoVim version v0.10.3
⚠️: This setup assumes presence of `ripgrep` installed on your system.

You may install it by following the instructions on their [github page](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

## `init.lua`

This file should be conventionally placed at the following location:


```shell
~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

I was using Lazy Nvim package manager for the [installation and the setup](https://lazy.folke.io/installation).
